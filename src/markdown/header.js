const header = `I am currently working as a Front-End Engineer for [Altocloud](https://www.altocloud.com), contributing to \
mulitple open source projects like [NASA OpenMCT](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/), \
[Storj](https://storj.io/) and the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/community.html), and dedicating \
some of my free time to developing applications with UNICEF. \


I am a big believer in the Agile Manifesto and a no-nonsense style of engineering. Building good software requires \
a good team, and a good team requires requires smart, dedicated, empathetic members. \
I'm also big on two new frontiers of software engineering: The Blockchain and AI, \
for their ability to enhance our future, but also because we need to be aware of how damaging these \
technologies could be if mishandled or misused. Oh yeah, I love engineering ethics too :D

Please take the time to read the rest of my resume, I am always interested to hear from other engineers \
or for potential opportunites for work, collaboration, etc.`;
